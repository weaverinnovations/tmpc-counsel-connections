### Decisions Made
1. **Next.js version**: `create-next-app@latest` installed Next.js 16.1.6 (not 15 as planned). This is fine — it's backward compatible.
2. **Middleware deprecation**: Next.js 16 shows a warning that "middleware" is deprecated in favor of "proxy". The middleware still works, but should be migrated in a future phase.
3. **Tailwind v4**: The latest Next.js uses Tailwind CSS v4, which is slightly different from v3 (no tailwind.config.ts, uses CSS-based configuration).
4. **Event day times**: Based on actual data analysis:
   - Monday Oct 6 (Virtual): 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM with breaks at 11:15, 12:15, 12:45-1:30
   - Tuesday Oct 7 (In-Person): 2:00 PM – 5:00 PM with break at 3:30-3:45
   - Wednesday Oct 8 (In-Person): 1:45 PM – 5:00 PM with break at 3:30-3:45
   - Thursday Oct 9 (In-Person): 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM with break at 10:30-10:45
5. **Attorney emails**: Some attorneys in the 03C file don't have emails (that file doesn't include emails). Emails are sourced from the 04 assignments file. Attorneys missing from both get placeholder emails.
6. **Companies from data**: 15 companies found (including Capital One and Trellix which weren't in PLAN.md's list). Flotek Industries appears only in the Cancelled sheet.
